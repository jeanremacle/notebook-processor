# Demo Assignment Instructions

## Objective

Complete all TODO cells in `demo_assignment.ipynb`. This assignment covers basic Python operations: recursion, string processing, and data structures.

## Requirements

- All verification cells must pass without modification
- Markdown answers should be 2-4 sentences minimum
- Code should include type hints and follow PEP 8

## Grading Criteria

- **Part 1 (Factorial):** Correct implementation, handles edge case n=0
- **Part 2 (Word Frequencies):** Handles punctuation stripping, case-insensitive
- **Part 3 (Analysis):** Demonstrates understanding of time complexity
- **Part 4 (Two-Sum):** Efficient implementation preferred
- **Part 5 (Reflection):** Thoughtful comparison with concrete examples

## Notes

- Do not modify verification cells
- You may add helper functions if needed
- Standard library only — no external packages required
